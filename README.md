Simple Go Application to view tables as in a web browser

working towards deploying this in a cluster and being able to view (and eventually CRUD) pods and kubernetes objects in that cluster

## Getting Started

#### Dependencies

 - [x] Install go version 1.13
 - [x] Run `make build`
 - [x] execute the web binary with: $ `./build/k-ates`
   > By default this runs it on local on port **80**, if this needs to be changed, run `export PORT=<Your new Value>`
 - [ ] Visit localhost:80
